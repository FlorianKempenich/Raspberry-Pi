# Raspberry Pi - Docker image

## Why? 

To allow compilation of C software to binaries compatible with raspberry pi.

On the distribution used by 'Rasplex', for example, there is no package manager,
and no (easy) way to install `make` for instance.

With this image, it is possible to compile binaries directly on your computer.
And they'll be compatible with your Raspberry Pi ... hopefully :)
